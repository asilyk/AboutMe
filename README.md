You need to continue working with the project [LogIn app](https://github.com/fabet/LoginApp) and improve it using the MVC scheme. This means that to store the user name, password and other information that should be displayed on the screen, you need to create a data model.

Using UITabBarController make more screens with interesting information about you and your hobbies (resume). Approach this process creatively. Use at least three screens.
